Question 1:
Given an array of positive integers, determine any one of the possible combination of elements in the array
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix is shown below:
Arr=1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 3
The top left to bottom right diagonal elements are 1+5+3 = 9
The top right to bottom left diagonal elements are 3+5+7 = 15
The absolute difference between them is 19-151 = 6
 
 
Question 2:
Write a program to swap the minimum and maximum numbers in an integer array
Example: arr =
in the above array, the minimum value Is -23 and the maximum value is 98. Sc those two values shoaid be
swapped.
The answer should be
 
 
Question 3:
Given a string, tind the first non-repeating character in that string.
Example:
In string 'TOTAL', there are 3 characters which did not repeat. They are O,A and L
The first non-repeating character is O which is the answer
Similarly, in string 'TEETER' the characters which did not repeat are R.
Rest all characters T and E occur more than once.
Hence the first non-repeating character is R
 
 
Question 4:
Scenario: You are building a database system for a library to track book borrowing and
user information. There are two tables:
• Books: Contains information about books like book_id, title, author, and genre.
• Borrowings: Contains borrowing history with data like borrowing_id, book_id, user_id, and
borrow_date.
Part 1: Write a SQL query that retrieves the total number of books borrowed for eacf2 genre.
use the Books and Borrowings tables.
Part 2: Write a SQL query that retrieves the title, author, and genre of all books currently
borrowed (i.e., not yet returned). Use the Books 2nd Borrowing tables.
